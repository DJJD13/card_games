# JD's Card Game Suite, built in C

This is a simple suite of various card games built in C. This is mainly a way for me to practice what I've learnt in C and put it into practice.

Right now, only blackjack is available. As time goes on, I want to add more card games, starting with Texas Hold 'em poker.

## Blackjack

A simple console based blackjack game. It is a 1 on 1 duel versus the Dealer. The controls are very simple

- [D]eal the cards
- [H]it
- [C]all
- [Q]uit

All the basics of Blackjack are there. In the future, I'd like to make the UI more engaging (being able to see current hand, visual representations of the cards, etc.). Any and all feedback is appreaciated!
